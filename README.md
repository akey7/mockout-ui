# x-mockout-ui
This is a build and burn react app, with new emphasis on something that does not look like crap.

Also, it is just a checklist of files.

## Directories to create

+ Create directory: `src/components`

+ Create directory: `src/actions`

+ Create directory: `src/reducers`

+ Create directory: `src/containers`

## Create the login form

The react component is at

```
src/components/login-form-component.js
```

and its CSS is at:

```
src/components/login-form-component.css
```
